A little bit about me...
</h2>
<p id="hobby">
  My name is Iveth Aguilar and I am an aspiring software/web developer. I am currently a senior attending the University of California, Merced. I am currently 
  completing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. On my past time I like to spend it in the ourdoors with my two dogs.

  Why I chose computer science as a career?
</h2>
<p id="whycs">
  The reason I chose to go into computer science was thanks to my 10th grade chemistry teacher. He introduced me to my first computer science course in high school.
  Since then I have had an interest in it. While working on coding assignments and projects it feels like I'm solving a big puzzle! Now I hope to turn it into a career.
